# Lockpick - Google Form Unlocker

This extension is designed to add Google (in an **iFrame**) to the bottom of a locked Google Form in locked mode.

## Keybindings
For power users the following keybindings exist:
- `Alt + L` - Close an iFrame 
- `Alt + O` - Open a new iFrame
- `Alt + B` - Hide/display all buttons
- `Ctrl + Shift + Alt + Q` **EMERGENCY BUTTON** - Completely destroys all evidence of the extension
## Installation
- Start by downloading and unzipping this repository
- Open chrome://extensions and enable `Developer Mode`
- Proceed to click `Load Unpacked` and choose the folder with this extension
- Visit a locked Google Form and use this extension!

Note: Once added it will show up as "AmongUs McDonalds" in your extensions list, in order to obfuscate it.

## Coming Soon
- There will be a way to set a custom URL to load on the bottom of the Google Form
